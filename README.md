# COVID-19 Tweet Sentiment Analysis

In this project I use tweets about COVID-19 (source: [COVID-19 NLP Text Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datatattle/covid-19-nlp-text-classification)) in order to perform Sentiment Analysis on them. The main goal of this project to become more familiar and dig deeper into NLP and, specifically, transformer models such as BERT and RoBERTa.
