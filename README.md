# COVID-19 Tweet Sentiment Analysis

In this project I use [tweets about COVID-19](https://www.kaggle.com/datatattle/covid-19-nlp-text-classification) in order to perform Sentiment Analysis on them. The main goal of this project to become more familiar and dig deeper into NLP and, specifically, transformer models such as BERT.
