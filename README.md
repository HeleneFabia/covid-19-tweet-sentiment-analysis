# COVID-19 Tweet Sentiment Analysis

In this project I use [tweets about COVID-19](https://www.kaggle.com/datatattle/covid-19-nlp-text-classification) in order to perform Sentiment Analysis on them. The main goal of this project to become more familiar and dive deeper into different NLP models, such as LSTM, GRU and transformer models like BERT.

#### Project updates

[09-2020]
- analyzing and visualizing statistics about the text data
- building a baseline model using `BERTForSequenceClassification`

[10-2020]
- building a baseline model using a LSTM network
- improving the LSTM model and testing the final version

#### Next steps
- improving the BERT model and compare its results to the LSTM model

***

#### Performance of the LSTM model
- Model architecture:
