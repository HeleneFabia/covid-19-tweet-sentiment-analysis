# COVID-19 Tweet Sentiment Analysis

In this project I use [tweets about COVID-19](https://www.kaggle.com/datatattle/covid-19-nlp-text-classification) in order to perform Sentiment Analysis on them. The main goal of this project to become more familiar and dig deeper into different NLP models, such as LSTM, GRU and transformer models like BERT.

### Project Updates

[09-2020]
- analyzing and visualizing statistics about the text data
- building and evaluating a model using `BERTForSequenceClassification`

[10-2020]
- building and evaluating a model using a LSTM network

### Next steps
- improving both the BERT and the LSTM model and comparing their results
